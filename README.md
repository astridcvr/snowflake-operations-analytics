# Snowflake Analytics Simulation Project

**Author:** Astrid Villalobos  
**Role:** Data Analyst – Portfolio Project  
**Tools:** Snowflake · SQL · Power BI · Kaggle · Data Modeling

## Project Overview

This project simulates an **end-to-end analytics workflow** using Snowflake and real-world e-commerce data from Kaggle.

To extend the analytical depth, the project generates **simulated production and technical testing datasets**, creating a **multi-domain analytics environment** similar to what technology, telecom, logistics, or manufacturing companies manage daily.

The project demonstrates:

- Database and schema design in Snowflake
- Table creation (real + simulated datasets)
- Analytical SQL (joins, window functions, KPIs)
- Production and quality monitoring
- Power BI dashboard development
- Reproducible, industry-style project structure

## Repository Structure

/sql
├── 01_create_tables.sql
├── 02_simulation_data.sql
└── 03_analysis_queries.sql

/dashboard

Each SQL file is modular and represents a distinct phase of the analytics workflow.

## Datasets Used

### Real Dataset (Kaggle — Olist E-commerce)

Customer, order, and item-level sales data.

Tables loaded into Snowflake:

- `CUSTOMERS`
- `ORDERS`
- `ORDER_ITEMS_DATASET`

---

## Simulated Datasets (Generated in Snowflake)

To replicate operational and technical monitoring scenarios, two synthetic tables were generated:

### `PRODUCTION_STATUS`
- Machine-level production tracking
- Units produced vs. units failed
- Failure rate calculation

### `TEST_RESULTS`
- Latency measurements
- Packet loss metrics
- Pass / fail classification

These datasets enable analytics across **commerce, operations, production, and quality monitoring**.

## Snowflake Architecture

- **Warehouse:** `DATA_WH`
- **Database:** `DATA_PROJECT`
- **Schema:** `ANALYTICS`

### Tables Overview

| Table Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `CUSTOMERS` | Customer demographic and location data |
| `ORDERS` | Order lifecycle events |
| `ORDER_ITEMS_DATASET` | Line-item pricing and product-level details |
| `PRODUCTION_STATUS` | Simulated production batches per machine |
| `TEST_RESULTS` | Simulated quality and performance test results |
